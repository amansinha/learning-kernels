% CREATEOPTIMIZEDGAUSSIANKERNELPARAMS generates parameters for an optimized
% Gaussian kernel. If we ask to create more random features than the number
% of features in the optmized kernel, we will just return the number of
% features in the optimized kernel. If we ask for fewer, then we sample
% from the distribution for the optimized kernel.
%
% Inputs:
% D is the number of random features we wish to generate
% W_opt, b_opt, alpha_distrib are outputs from OptimizeGaussianKernel
%
% Outputs:
% D_new the number of random features we actually have now
% W_new, b_new the parameters for those random features
